Beats Thirst is a concept for a line of canned water.

## Vision
 Think Liquid Death but with dope beats on tap (upon scanning rather ðŸ˜‰).

 The company would leverage some of our following from a previous startup, Cipher and position ourselves for a collaboration with BeatStars. Getting music right into people's hands and fostering the spirit of hip hop would be rad. 

 Currently working on a storyboard with producer Trademark Media to test market receptivity. Having secured beatsthirst(.com) we're in talks with can makers and a local artesian water bottling company to potentially partner with.
