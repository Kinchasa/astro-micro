## Hakuna Matata

Elton John nailed the soundtrack didn’t he? The Lion King movie came out in 1994, the last classic Disney smash hit before Pixar’s Toy Story debuted revolutionizing animation. I recall my teachers impressing upon me what a big deal that film was in the way of technology.

But before I saw Toy Story in the gymnasium at St. Paul’s Lutheran I was, under duress, made to sing *Hakuna Matata* and *Can You Feel the Love Tonight* there in the 3rd grade talent show, with none other than fellow ginger, Kendall Hott.

Little events, observations and symbols are the bricolage of life that make up one’s sense of identity. Up until the talent show, I had it on good authority, from a rather reputable placemat at the Gold Inn Chinese restaurant that my spirit animal was the Fire Tiger. Though my mom always called me Gare-Bear, but here I’m apparently a Lion? Lion, tiger or bear!? Oh my, who am I?

We’re all in a lifelong journey of finding out who we are, through the lenses we don for various situations, our choices, actions and habits — mundane or more decisive, pivotal moments.

This is my attempt to make sense of life after taking the ~~red~~ orange pill of Bitcoin.

## Degenerate Cub

I’m a composite of several characters in Lion King, more Simba than Scar, more Timone than Pumba (though I did a mean vibrado “When I was a young warthogggg” line in tenor). Nevertheless, I’m trying to “Mufasa my Kinchasa” as it were, and reflecting on my faults is all I can do to try and rise to become a better man and to take those learnings into what I do.

Like Simba, I’ve felt haunted by regret and guilt, casting myself into exile following my divorce. I could have been a better husband on multiple fronts, but the dealbreaker was in my financial indiscretions, spending on yup — you guessed it — NFTs to a large tune.

We had agreed to buy $500 in Bitcoin and a full Ethereum which was $400 or so at the time. Then when ETH dropped to $100 I figured.. “Well shit, if it’s not worth anything I’ll at least experiment with it on these newfangled interwebs.” Having read about Crypto Kitties, these digital cats you breed, one of which fetched $140k, I knew something was going on here. My friend Dan dismissed it as them “making a market” or engaging in wash sales, which do indeed happen in crypto, no doubt. But then I saw this Gods Unchained project, basically Magic the Gathering on blockchain — a card drafting game that my brother made a killing on, selling his grail of a set a few years prior. It had a purpose beyond just a collectible, these ownable digital objects, tradeable online 27/7 with no intermediaries. It wasn’t just money that drove me, it was raw curiosity.

What got me was the unboxing experience, where you dragged the pack onto this mystic stone and it electrified the pack, along with your dopamine receptors, finally revealing the cards. All said, in retrospect I would’ve played my cards differently in my personal life, as it were, making my case and finding compromise rather than go around her continuing to buy ETH to spend on digital tchotchkes.

The obsession came at the expense of everyday life. In my defense, it was maddening for me, realizing there was something new under the sun here in blockchain and not having anyone to share in this newfound passion with in-person, in a healthy way. Everyone around me just looked at me dumbfounded. I lacked the language to properly describe it, they may have lacked the interest to receive it, regardless I felt alone. That is until, having Googled my way to a dead end, I logged back into my baron Twitter account to poke around. WOW, that was where the pulse was and where my people were.

## What’s in a Name?

As I surveyed the landscape of crypto Twitter, @InvariablyGarett didn’t quite fit the bill anymore. Pumba thought of changing his name in the song Hakuna Matata. It occurred to me I had no idea how to use Twitter. I didn’t have a niche interest to keep a finger on the pulse of, until now that is.

When I went to change my Twitter(X) handle I recalled being on a balcony with my friend Grant, soaking up the scene looking out at the mountains in Breckenridge, CO on a ski trip. I said something to the effect of “Grant, you’re boy, my amigo, you’re my Kinchasa!” It just came out of me from nowhere. He said.. “No Garett, you’re the Kinchasa.” I was like “oh my God, I am” feigning some gravity 😅. I would go on to choose @Kinchasa5000 as my moniker going forward, people would shorten to Kin, a name I continue to ascribe meaning to and derive meaning from.

Fancying myself a fledgling web3 revolutionary, I copped pirate punk #2260 for $131, leaning into that character of Kin. Embodying a character and acting with character though are two different things, the latter being able to move with courage at any given point in time. When I made the choice to spend without consulting my wife it was out of convenience and conviction but not on principles. Kin isn’t an act, it’s a part of who I am, but I’m resolved to act on principle in the future, valuing relationships more and being someone others can rely on. Making good decisions in life relies on a deep reservoir of strength, faith and clarity — I had only blind faith back then but the experience has made me stronger and I’m seeking to see the world as it is, better able to differentiate between what is and what could be.

Through Twitter, I discovered SuperRare, a marketplace for single-edition (1/1’s) digital artworks that somehow felt more tangible in the whole experience. I would talk to artists about their process, gaining knowledge of aesthetics and deriving more meaning from these works — this is the new stock and trade of social media in ownership. I’ve traveled to visit these artists, met them at conferences, went surfing together — this isn’t static imagery or meaningless bits, it’s a new means to bring people together and ascribe meaning to things and experiences in our lives that are increasingly spent online. But to speak endlessly of community in web3 and not anchoring it in personal life does us a woeful disservice.

## Facing Scar

Through soul searching and a legit spiritual practice, I can now forgive myself having confronted Scar, the side of me that feeds into addictive behaviors. Anything that’s got a hold on you is a terrible albatross to carry and I’ve realized that to always be “wanting” is the opposite of gratitude. By routinely expressing how grateful I am for what I do still have gives me peace of mind, better able to convert energy otherwise spent on striving for putting in the work to achieve my goals. The wins we’ve chalked up against Scar as the ills representing the nation state should be celebrated but we must face the wreckage of our past.

I’ve had my fair share of fits and starts in web3 but the teacher Rafiki appears to me when my endeavors are earnest and grounded in reality. Returning to “The Pride” to continue this exhausted metaphor, I’m seeing signs of recovery in myself and in the space as the downturn has purged many of the false prophets and hucksters — perhaps I was once one of them to some degree.

As we crawl out of the trough of disillusionment in NFTs and crypto at large, we can now see a pathway up the slope to enlightenment where we begin to cash the checks on the promise of web3 — this idea that anyone with an internet connection should be able to participate in this new economy, no permission required. I know when and where to ask for permission now and asking it of the nation state still does not apply. Web3 doesn’t need to gravel for forgiveness either for choosing to innovate in the face of tyranny by complacency. We must pull what “could be” into the now, continuing to sand down the rough edges of onboarding. The Circle of Life doesn’t call for death, it happens naturally as better systems and ways of living through technology emerge. Remember that we’re dealing with a fundamental underpinning of life, our time being the scarcest resource we have so our ability to decouple our earning potential from it represents one of the greatest goods we can afford humanity — to make our money work for us — ALL of us. It’s not WAGMI — “We Are Gonna Make It” this is “We Are Gonna Take It” WAGTI.

I’m taking up the call to adventure once more, Rafiki will appear when I’m ready. My life is like a big long dumb poem that doesn’t rhyme.. up until now. Let’s act with duty, full of character and lean into our characters on a path that might come to feel like destiny. The rest will work out if we will it with “right and might over ignorance, superstition and greed” as my grandpa Terry always said. Seek balance in all respects and we will find out who we truly are.
