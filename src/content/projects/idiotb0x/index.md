Idiotb0x, a fledgling startup by yours truly, aimed to blend web3 and AI making crypto as easy as a conversation.

## TLDR;

Idiotb0x is a “curious instrument”, a chatbot in fact, helping people become their best selves and relate to one another through the power of story. With a woodgrain exterior and ChatGPT under the hood, we’re pioneering “showgrams” — edutainment slides that grow up to become films.

Be the hero and choose your own adventure at the frontier of AI and web3. Artificial Intelligence holds up a mirror to humanity; how we interact with it reflects back on us, our knowledge, sense of character and cohesion. Andy Warhol predicted “in the future, everyone will have 15 minutes of fame..” and now potential fortune all in one internet-native, media asset known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Idiotb0x’s namesake comes from old slang for TV. Steve Martin once joked “Ah the Television.. the world’s most watched appliance!” We’re optimizing for as little screen time as possible by positioning it as the first paper social network of knowledge through flashcards and a new category of greetings creating an immediate revenue stream while creating powerful network effects and word-of-mouth.

We now truly stand on the shoulders of giants with AI, taking man’s greatest store of knowledge— the internet—now accessible in “a keystroke or words spoke” regardless of skill or reading level. Idiotb0x can sum up any topic down to a flashcard with a QR code to expound on it at will.. you might say we’re really “dumbing it up”.
Many showgrams will have an “edutainment” (educational/ feature immersive narration and dynamic captions).

We stand at a turning point. Will we “seize the memes” compressing the complexities of the world down into visual metaphors and devise a collective arbiter of truth? Or will we just outsource our brains to AI and succumb to our future robot overlords?

## Tabling the Project

While it's a tough decision to shelve a project, limited runway and aspirations to re-enter the job market have pulled me away from it, but I will always be an idi0t at heart, grasping at what I don't fully understand with curiosity and wonder.
