## Rhymes and Magic Lanterns

I wrote a rhyme back in the Cipher days (my now shuttered “collectible hip hop” music NFT startup) that went something like this:

> *Money? Nahh, crypto’s a disease — one you get diagnosed with over cocktails and cheese. 30,000-headed snake of the interweb jungle, Man fucked up now, genie out the bottle!*

Satoshi rubbed that lamp just right, didn't he? Or was it her? They/them? What a legendary case of confusing pronouns, though all need not be shrouded in such mystery — I’d prefer to know as to make people feel comfortable, ya know? Is anyone else experiencing culture warfare fatigue?

In any case, the message was clear in that seminal shot across the bow: “Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout of Banks” which Satoshi encoded as a message into the first block of Bitcoin, the “Genesis Block'' kicking off the chain, releasing what would go on to become the surliest genie one could ever imagine, with no intention on returning to his prison of a bottle. With zero fucks to give but 2 out of 3 wishes granted, Satoshi wisely chose Security and Decentralization, leaving Scalability for a future date, as are the tradeoffs in the ‘Blockchain Trillemma’ as coined by Vitalik Buterin, boy-genius front man behind Ethereum.

## You’ve Got a Friend in web3

All this conjures up some key lines in the Disney classic, Aladdin and its song “Never Had a Friend Like Me” voiced by the late Robin Williams as the Genie trying to explain the power now in our hands:

> *I don’t think you quite realize what you got here*
>
> *So why don’t you just ruminate while I illuminate.. the possibilities*

While we must stop just short of “magical thinking” and be pragmatic relative to current levels of adoption, many fail to see the vast implications at play here or the array of viable applications once critical mass is reached. Remember, we’re dealing with a new medium akin to “Digital Marble”, a trust enhancing technology here and now, but a store of record for mankind that may live into millennia. With this new hardening of the web, the victors of wars can no longer re—write history to their liking. This is the stuff of real ideals like Truth and Justice we’re that much closer to grasping if only more can grasp what’s going on here.

> *Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves,*
>
> *Scheherezad-ei had a thousand tales*

We’ve heard the narrative from the old guard for long enough as they piss on our legs but forecast it’s raining in the form of trickle—down economics, while inflation steals the fruits of our labor. Hyperbolic caution to the wind, we’re subject to a form of wholesale extraction, with a 1/3 of our treasure feeding the very pernicious military industrial complex Eisenhower warned us about with the nation state’s “monopoly on violence.”

> *You got some power in your corner now,*
>
> *Some heavy ammunition in your camp*

Sufficiently decentralized blockchains distribute power out at the periphery, into the hands of many over the default MO where the few and privileged actors call the shots, which is why “centralization” is so villainized in web3.

SHA-256, the hashing algorithm employed in Bitcoin was quite actually classified as a “munition” a banned technology for years, unavailable to the public and many researchers and technologists. If it’s a munition, access to it is a right granted by the 2nd amendment and the Right to Bear Arms, hence “I trust encryption like I trust ammunition.” Government “protections” at times feel like those of a mafioso. Guess what, money is also a form of speech and it will remain free and clear from interference.

> *You got my bonafides, certified*
>
> *You got a genie for your charge d’affaires*

Perhaps here our friend illuminates the credible neutrality of the blockchain and how applications built atop it can enable a better form of credentialing — a notary of sorts, based on math, the closest thing we have to truth, whereas bias, inequality and inefficiency are baked into traditional institutions’ very gears. Taken as a whole, it helps us to act in our own best interest, the individuals’ diplomat dispatched inwards at its own state when our representatives seem to have lost the plot, forgetting who they serve.

At the end of the day, this shit isn’t magic, it’s math underpinning this newfangled money. It still requires faith, but it’s better than money based on faith alone.
