## Diagnosis
"Sir, is this a good time to discuss your evaluation? Ah, yes then.. well, I regret to inform you, you've been inflicted with blockchain" says a solemn doctor in an emerging field of societal medicine known as web3. 

"Oh no! I have blockchain?" you ask. "Well not exactly." says this fiction of a doctor, "No one person 'has' blockchain — it takes a village to raise one and a whole lotta hardware and electricity, but once unleashed they cannot be stopped or controlled by any one person or entity. No.. I'm afraid blockchain has you." 

## Treatment
"What do I do doc? Ya gotta help me!" you say in the desparate plea of a 1920-era bootlegger's cracking voice.

"Well there are treatments available" the doctor says a bit bemused, "the most promising of which is 'DEGENlite', a three pronged treatment plan entailing an aggressive, but balanced portfolio, balance in life — including a content diet and a strict regiment of 'touching grass.' It's perfectly understandable how its progressed this far, all things in moderation — and in time, once you recover you'll be able to practice moderation in moderation and be able to 'sweep the floor' once again."

"Thanks doc, you're a lifesaver." you beam.

"Well it isn't an entirely bad thing as you've built up a resistance to fuckery." he quipped "Not everyone will have the sufficient interest to be inflicted with the condition as severely as you have, but regardless of whether or not one 'subscribes' to crypto, it will _affect_ everything and therefore touch the lives of everyone."

## Proud Cockroach 
There are plenty of luke warm takes like "Attack of the 50 foot blockchain" by David Gerard or a a decent, if unflattering piece by The Economist magazine drawing parallels between crypto and cockroaches 🪳 menaces that spread disease, seemingly unkillable even after cutting off their heads (CZ of Binance or SBF of FTX exchanges).

That property of resilience is a direct result of the key tenet of crypto’s “sacred jargon” if you will, known as “decentralization” — a redundant network structure prioritizing security trading off for efficiency and throughput somewhat.

The blend of technologies and design choices in Bitcoin, include the Merkle Tree, the data structure used for verification and synchronization of the chain. Its inventor, Ralph Merkle conceived of it without a clear use case and only in retrospect, described its use in Bitcoin as giving this “organism” a heart that beats every 10 minutes with a block reward incentivizing the operators of the network or “miners.” While there is human intervention and upgrades that take place on the core protocol, it largely operates autonomously, a living digital thing — an 18,000 headed hydrant as that’s how many public “nodes” or computers synching the chain there are with many more running privately.

That word public crops up in broader discussions around blockchains sometimes referred to as DLT, “Distributed Ledger Technologies.”  They are more simply known as “public ledgers” that anyone can peer into unlike traditional, private bookkeeping systems of the likes of the “Big Four.” These being major accounting firms including Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and EY, Ernst & Young, this latter of which has made the most strides in and open-source contributions to blockchain protocols like its “Nightfall” release enabling private transactions on public ledgers for businesses looking to mitigate their slow slide into the tarpits of their own obsolescence should their patterns of complacency persist.
